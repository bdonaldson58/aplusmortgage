    <p class="bio-info"><strong> My name is Brendan Donaldson. I grew up in Saint Joseph, Missouri. I graduated from the University of Missouri with a Bachelor's of Science in Business Administration, where I also was a 2 year letterwinner in Football. I have worked a few different jobs since school (see resume) but I never really found my passion until I started coding. When I first stumbled upon an HTML course on Khan Academy in mid-2015 I didn't realize it at the time but I was finally figuring out what I wanted to do for the rest of my life. Ever since then, coding has been a hobby of mine, and I have been learning as much as possible. I have been through so many tutorials, and I am currently going through a course on FreeCodeCamp.com, which is an amazing program. But I am also developing my own projects on the side, because that is how I learn best, and that's what makes coding so much fun. It is my dream to start a career as a software or web developer and I am doing as much as possible to make that dream a reality.</strong></p>
