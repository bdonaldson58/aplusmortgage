    <p class="bio-info"><strong> My name is Brendan Donaldson. I grew up in Saint Joseph, Missouri. I graduated 
    from the University of Missouri with a Bachelor's of Science in Business Administration, where I also was a
    2 year letterwinner in Football. And just to give you an idea of what is going on with this site, this is a mock
    website for a mortgage broker firm, A-Plus Mortgage (my dad's business), that I am creating to showcase my coding skills.
    It's far from finished but I'm spending as much time as possible adding to the site and making it the best it can possibly be.
    </strong></p>
    <p class= "bio-info"><strong>
    When I first stumbled upon an HTML course on Khan Academy in early 2015,  
    I didn't realize it at the time but I was finally figuring out what I wanted to do for the rest of my life.
    Ever since then, coding has been a hobby of mine, and I have been learning as much as possible. I have been 
    through so many tutorials, and I am currently going through a course on FreeCodeCamp.com, which is an amazing
    program. But I am also developing my own projects on the side, because that is how I learn best, and that's
    what makes coding so much fun. It is my dream to start a career as a software or web developer and I am doing
    as much as possible to make that dream a reality.</strong></p>
